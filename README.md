# Grazioso Salvare Animal Shelter's web application dashboard. 

It was produced last semester for the CS340 class. The dashboard allows users to choose a rescue type, filter data in a table, and examine accompanying charts and maps. This artifact demonstrates my software development talents, including Python, Dash, Flask, MongoDB, and Plotly. The inclusion of the method increases data processing efficiency, proving my ability to optimize code for performance.

The upgrade supports the course objectives of designing database solutions and accomplishing project goals. The method enhances data processing, which is critical to database operations and project efficiency.

Throughout the improvement process, I learnt about algorithm optimization and its effect on data processing speed. I encountered difficulties in effortlessly incorporating the algorithm into the current software while ensuring that it enhanced overall speed without creating mistakes. Overall, this upgrade project was a fantastic learning opportunity that helped me improve my abilities in database administration, algorithm optimization, and software development.
